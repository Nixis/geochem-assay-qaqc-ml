# Geochem Orebody Proximity Prediction

*Machine learning classification of geochemical drill assays to predict orebody proximity (proximal vs distal samples).*

---

## üìå Project Overview
This project uses geochemical assay data from **Datarock‚Äôs Broken Down lead deposit (Tasmania)** to build a predictive model that classifies drill samples into two groups:  

- **Class A** ‚Üí Proximal to the orebody  
- **Class B** ‚Üí Distal from the orebody  

The aim is to automate orebody proximity classification for future drill holes using machine learning.

## üìä Data Description
- **Total samples**: 4,472  
- **Features**: 8 geochemical elements (As, Au, Zn, Fe, S, Cu, Mo, Pb)  
- **Labels**: Class A (proximal), Class B (distal), and ~800 unlabeled samples (`?`)  
- **Additional metadata**: `uniqueID`, `holeid`, `from`, `to`  
- **Issues handled**: missing values, invalid values (`-999`, characters), detection limit inconsistencies  

---

## üîÑ Workflow
1. **QAQC & Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Remove invalid values (-999, non-numeric entries)  
   - Normalize / standardize assays  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution plots for each element  
   - Correlation matrix  
   - PCA projection to visualize class separation  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Algorithms tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
   - Cross-validation for performance metrics  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Feature importance (which elements contribute most to classification)  

5. **Prediction on Unlabeled Samples**  
   - Generate predicted labels for the `?` samples  
   - Export results for downstream use

## üìà Results
- **Best model:** Random Forest (placeholder ‚Äì update once tested)  
- **Accuracy:** XX%  
- **Key features:** Fe, Pb, S (example ‚Äì update with real importance plot)  

**Example outputs (to include once generated):**  
- Feature importance bar chart  
- Confusion matrix heatmap  
- PCA plot with predicted vs actual labels

## üß™ QA/QC Notes
- The dataset does not include explicit **units** for assays.  
- **Trace elements** (As, Au, Pb, Mo, Cu, Zn) are treated as **ppm** (mg/kg).  
- **Major elements** (Fe, S) are reported in ranges consistent with **ppm equivalents of wt% assays** (1% = 10,000 ppm).  
- Fe and S are kept in **ppm**, but conversion to wt% (`Fe/10,000`, `S/10,000`) is noted as an option for geological interpretation.
- Unit consistency was reviewed and documented, but full harmonization is left out of scope at this stage. Is noted that mixing ppm and % without harmonization can distort multivariate analysis (PCA, clustering, ML). 
- Raw vs log plots confirmed that log transformation is essential for managing skewed geochemical distributions.

## üìùNotes on Data Treatment

- During exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced steps such as **anomaly detection**, **background separation**, and **integration with geological context** were considered.  
- Such methods are commonly applied in geochemical datasets to improve signal-to-noise distinction and enhance geological interpretation.  However, in this project these steps were **intentionally left out** to maintain focus on the main workflow.
- The dataset was carried forward using **log-transformed values**, which provided sufficient normalization for the analysis objectives.
