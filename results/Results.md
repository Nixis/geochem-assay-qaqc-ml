### Modeling (Feasibility)

The QAQC and EDA confirmed that the geochemical assay dataset can be cleaned and structured for analysis.  
However, on its own the dataset is **not sufficient** for robust predictive modeling.  
The dataset needs to be **enriched with additional features** and **guided by domain expertise** before predictive models can be applied with confidence.  
Further work is required to integrate geological context, spatial information, and larger labeled datasets to improve feasibility.

## ðŸ“ˆ Findings (from QAQC + EDA)
- **Log transform is essential** (skew reduction, clearer patterns).  
- Strong signals from **Cu, Zn, Pb, Mo**, with Fe and S providing context.  
- **As** retained (31% missing) with flags; **Au** often near detection limit.  
- **Imbalance** will bias naive models â†’ use class weights or resampling.
